# Gimi tools


A simple blender add-on for facilitating the use of the blender addon GIMI
this add-on adds five menus to vertex group context menu/special menu

**1. Merge shared name VGs**  
    looks at the active selected VG (y) then merges all y.xxx VGs to y; then it sorts the VGs  
**2. Merge shared name VGs with the active VG**  
    searches ALL VGs (y) and merges all y.xxx VGs to y; then it sorts the VGs
**3. Fill VGs**  
    finds the lowest numbered existing VG and the highest one, then fills all the space between them so no number would be missing between the lowest and highest; then it sorts the VGs  
**4. Remove unused VGs**  
    looks at all the VGs finds the one that have no verts added and weighetd to them, then removes them  
**5. Sort VGs**  
    ascending sorts the VGs
